//Console log

//console.log has nothing to do with jQuery. It is a common object/method provided by debuggers (including the Chrome debugger and Firebug) that allows a script to log data (or objects in most cases) to the JavaScript console.

console.log('Hello'); //displays Hello in console (Inspect Element)
